publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of a recipient of the
Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. When You distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work, You
may not impose any technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability
of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work
as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective
Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as
required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon
notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.</p>

applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor

reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor

part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for
the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use
the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may
not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship
