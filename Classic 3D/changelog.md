Sorry about not releasing this sooner. The fixes have been sitting on GitHub for the past month, but I've been going through a lot. I hope you all enjoy!

Changes:

- Cleaned out unnecessary files
- Optimized Brewing Stand block model

Fixes:

- Purpur Pillar's horizontal block state didn't work
- Fixed issue with some textures not being in the texture atlases ([#19](https://github.com/RyanGar46/Classic-3D/issues/19))
